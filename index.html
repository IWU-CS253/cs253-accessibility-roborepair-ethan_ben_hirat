            <p>Founded in 2020 by a group of robotics enthusiasts and engineers, RoboCare started as a small workshop dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of classic robot models. We quickly realized that many robot owners faced challenges in finding parts and technical support for their retired mechanical companions. This inspired us to expand our services, and today, we are proud to be the leading provider of spare parts for retired robots.</p>
